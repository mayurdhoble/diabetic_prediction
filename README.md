# Diabetic Prediction with Hyperparameter Tuning for Logistic Regression and SMOTE technique to balance the unbalance data

This project aims to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on a medical dataset. We will utilize machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression with hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV, to achieve the best possible accuracy.

## 1. Data Preprocessing: Balancing Unbalanced Classes with SMOTE

Real-world datasets often suffer from class imbalance, where one class (e.g., diabetic patients) is significantly underrepresented compared to the other (e.g., non-diabetic patients). This imbalance can negatively impact the performance of machine learning models.

To address this issue, we will employ the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) technique. SMOTE creates synthetic data points for the minority class by interpolating between existing minority class samples. This helps to balance the class distribution and improve the model's ability to learn from both classes effectively.

## 2. Hyperparameter Tuning with GridSearchCV

GridSearchCV is a powerful tool for optimizing the hyperparameters of a machine learning model. It exhaustively evaluates a predefined set of hyperparameter values and selects the combination that yields the best performance on a held-out validation set.

In this project, we will use GridSearchCV to tune the hyperparameters of the Logistic Regression model.

By systematically searching through different hyperparameter combinations, GridSearchCV helps us identify the configuration that maximizes the model's accuracy for predicting diabetes.

## 3. Logistic Regression for Diabetic Prediction:

Logistic Regression is a linear classification algorithm well-suited for binary classification tasks like predicting diabetes (diabetic or non-diabetic). It models the relationship between the independent variables (patient features) and the dependent variable (diabetes diagnosis) using a logistic function.

By analyzing the features of a new patient, the trained Logistic Regression model can estimate the probability of that patient having diabetes. By setting a threshold on this probability, we can classify the patient as diabetic or non-diabetic.

## 4. Conclusion:
   
This project combines SMOTE for class balancing, GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, and Logistic Regression for model building to achieve a robust and accurate prediction of diabetes. This approach can be further enhanced by exploring other classification algorithms and evaluating different performance metrics.
